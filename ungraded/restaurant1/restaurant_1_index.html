                <br>
                Here at the Lazy Mussel, we import frozen mussels from Havelock, New Zealand.  The critics all said that
                mussels frozen and shipped half way across the world wouldn't taste as good, and, well, in retrospect they may
                have been right.  But we imported three tons of them and they're still edible so now we serve them to our customers.
                Enjoy the mussels served on top of various things- a bed of rice, ice cream, pumpkin pie, and probably other things.
